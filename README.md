# Water Quality Monitoring using Arduino and ESP8266

Develop an IoT system for monitoring water quality in environments such as fish ponds. Utilize Blynk as the cloud service to manage data and facilitate communication between sensors and user interfaces. Blynk provides a custom web and mobile app builder, enabling users to easily visualize and interact with water quality data. Implement features such as real-time monitoring and historical data analysis to ensure optimal water conditions.
